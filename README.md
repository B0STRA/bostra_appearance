## Installation
1. This is a fork of [pushkart2's](https://github.com/pushkart2/appearance) fork of [illenium-appearance](https://github.com/iLLeniumStudios/illenium-appearance/) to allow custom file names. So rename your folder to whatever you want but the exports will need to be the same as your resource folder name.

2. Follow original installation documentation [here](https://docs.illenium.dev), if you have installed previously, just drag and drop the new files in, change the resource name to `illenium-appearance` if you have added exports elsewhere previously. 

3. Enjoy.
